##  Overview

This essay critically evaluates Germany’s target to achieve 80% renewables in power consumption by 2030, as outlined in the Renewable Energy Sources Act (EEG). It explores both technical and political dimensions of the Energiewende, assessing whether current trends and policy environments support or hinder the feasibility of this goal.

## Structure

The essay is structured into three main sections:

1. **Case for achieving the target**
   - Momentum in solar capacity additions
   - Declining battery and solar PV costs
   - Projected generation based on capacity-growth trends

2. **Case against achieving the target**
   - Political instability and budget constraints
   - Rise of climate-sceptic parties
   - Cannibalisation effect and declining capture rates
   - Cuts to renewable subsidies

3. **Discussion and conclusion**
   - Evaluates both cases
   - Argues that without increased public investment, the target is unlikely to be met
   - Highlights battery deployment as a key but insufficient stabilising factor
